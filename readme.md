## Advent of Code solutions
This repo will act as a running repository for my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions. I will undoubtably take much longer than the length of each event to solve every puzzle but I will slowly but surely work my way through them as a fun way to keep myself in practice.

I am not a particularly good programmer, which if anything should be reassurance that anyone can solve the puzzles with some clever thinking and ~~knowing what to Google~~ a little familiarity with your programming language of choice. I highly recommend trying to solve the puzzles on your own rather than just running my, likely very sub-optimal, solutions on your puzzle inputs.

Each year's repository will specify any and all necessary instructions to run the solutions, or at least detail what I did to run them.
